*Why?*

I used to check my company's stock price constantly. Each rise and fall stirred my emotions. It was a rollercoaster.

Then I got some wonderful advice: look beyond the daily numbers. Understand the broader market trends and what's happening with comps.

The stock’s daily dance is just a small part of a bigger picture. So I wanted to build something that would help me get oriented, and also help others.

It's about perspective – seeing beyond the immediate to grasp the larger story.
